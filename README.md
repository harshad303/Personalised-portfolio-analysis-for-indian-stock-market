Portfolio Management is the process of maximizing the return on a portfolio. Portfolio managers make trading decisions on behalf of their clients depending on their appetite for risk. They analyze different assets, their strengths and weaknesses before making a decision about which equities they should hold in a portfolio for balancing the risk and drawing maximum returns. This makes portfolio management a difficult process. We aim to make this process better and simpler by using predictive modeling and deep learning techniques. We generate stable portfolios on predicted stock prices for next quarter.
